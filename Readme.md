LoadcellSensor 
==============

https://github.com/ChrisVeigl/LoadcellSensor

This is a library for processing raw values from a load cell or similar sensor for application in HCI applications (e.g. for mouse cursor control).

The values are noise-filtered and compared to a baseline which adapts to slow drifting. Overshoot compensation and automatic calibration are supported.
