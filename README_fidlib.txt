"fidlib" filter design library
------------------------------

This directory contains a copy of some of the files from the most
recent version of the fidlib source code.  THIS IS NOT THE MASTER
COPY.  Whilst 'fidlib' was originally written to serve as the filter
engine for Fiview, it is now distributed separately.  For the latest
version of fidlib, for the 'firun' tool, and for full documentation,
see the fidlib release page:
